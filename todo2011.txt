* Merge onto git repo
* All TODO in code
* Fix Eclipse project warnings
* DSAL on Mac

Test procedures:
* verify saving and loading a model

* Can we load model saved on a different machine? We should be able to.

* Updating is not automatic - we need to do more than just put up a new jar file.
  This seems strange, because the updater should just check the server time stamp on the jar file.

 * Can we send the log file in email?
 * Put version number in About menu?
 * Check that it runs correctly in both locally and from JAR.



Build procedures
* How to sign applet/application
* Make timestamp.txt work in PopRun.java -- see TODO

* Why doesn't build put resource files from source into build directory?


* Plan for Help file...
  Put this in one spot, it's a bit tricky.
  Have in "install" directory, and look in there. If it's not there, copy it from:
    (1) Using getResource(), or if that fails...
    (2) From Web site

PDF Opening:
This works:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 8.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" /A "page=13=OpenActions" "file:///C:/Users/Lars/PopulusHelp.pdf"
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Reader 8.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" /A "page=13=OpenActions" "file:///D:/PopulusHelpEnglish5.5.pdf"
Desktop doesn't seem to work...? ? ?
Using File helps, but must execute, not run through Desktop.

Installer issues

* Why didn't it get the new version of the JAR file we installed?

* Test that if the client does not have Java installed, it should automatically download it. It *should* work:

* Create shortcuts if requested
* flash screen
