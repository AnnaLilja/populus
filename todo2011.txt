* Merge onto git repo
* All TODO in code
* Fix Eclipse project warnings
* DSAL on Mac

Test procedures:
* verify saving and loading a model

* Can we load model saved on a different machine? We should be able to.
* Update to 5.5 in several spots:
  * flash screen
  * other stuff

* We should have a debug console window.  What normally happens to stdout? Can we bring that up easily?
* Add buildjar.xml file in project

* Updating is not automatic - we need to do more than just put up a new jar file.
  This seems strange, because the updater should just check the server time stamp on the jar file.


* Font for disabled buttons is still dark.

Build procedures
* How to sign applet/application
* Make timestamp.txt work in PopRun.java -- see TODO

* Plan for Help file...
  Put this in one spot, it's a bit tricky.
  Have in "install" directory, and look in there. If it's not there, copy it from:
    (1) Using getResource(), or if that fails...
    (2) From Web site


Installer issues

* Why didn't it get the new version of the JAR file we installed?

* Test that if the client does not have Java installed, it should automatically download it. It *should* work:

* Create shortcuts if requested
* flash screen
